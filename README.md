## Description
The React Portfolio I have build is a single page application that uses react to populate four different pages. Upon rendering the site, a user will see the "about me" page with a photo of myself as well as a brief description of myself. all the buttons on the headers adn footers are functional as well. In the "Portfolio" page, i have populated 6 projects/ assignments for the user to see. (NOTE: one application is backend only so it will not populate a deployed site & the Jolly project is my final project for class and has not been published as of yet). On the resume page, I have provided a list of front and back end proficiencies. On the left their is a button that will download a copy of (what will be) my resume straight to the computer. Last on the "Contact" page, the user can add into the imput text boxes, and the application will listen for responces and let the user know if they have left a field empty. The email validator will also check to see if the users email is i fact valid.

(NOTE: I had many more commits on my first repository, had some githuib issues and tried to self diagnose and ended up having to delete the repository and create another remotely and add in my code.)
